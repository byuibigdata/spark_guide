## Navigation

- This file provides a high-level overview of Databricks.
- The HTML folder contains notebooks that can be imported into Databricks. All HTML files in that folder can be imported individually, or you can use `examples.dbc` to import them all at once.

_Here is a bit more nerdy DS/CS pitch [from their website](https://databricks.com/company/about-us)_

> With origins in academia and the open-source community, Databricks was founded in 2013 by the original creators of Apache Spark™, Delta Lake, and MLflow. As the world’s first and only lakehouse platform in the cloud, Databricks combines the best of data warehouses and data lakes to offer an open and unified platform for data and AI.

## Databricks Community Edition

The [community edition](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html) provides free access to the Databricks environment to see their vision of jupyter notebooks and to work with a Spark environment. The users do not incur any costs while using Databricks.

Read more about the limitations of Community Edition at [this FAQ](https://databricks.com/product/faq/community-edition).

### Community Edition Setup

1. Create a [community account on Databricks](https://databricks.com/try-databricks)
2. Login into the [Databricks community edition portal](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html)
3. Click the compute icon on the left (![](https://github.com/byuibigdata/project_safegraph/blob/main/img/compute_icon.png))
4. Name your cluster
5. Create your cluster and then navigate to the libraries tab to install our needed Python packages (for example `gql`, `plotnine`, `altair`). Pandas is already installed.


## What is the difference between the Databricks Community Edition and the full Databricks Platform?

> With the Databricks Community Edition, the users will have access to 15GB clusters, a cluster manager and the notebook environment to prototype simple applications, and JDBC / ODBC integrations for BI analysis. The Databricks Community Edition access is not time-limited and users will not incur AWS costs for their cluster usage.

> The full Databricks platform offers production-grade functionality, such as an unlimited number of clusters that easily scale up or down, a job launcher, collaboration, advanced security controls, and expert support. It helps users process data at scale, or build Apache Spark applications in a team setting.
