# Using Spark for exploratory data analysis

## What is Spark?

> From its humble beginnings in the AMPLab at U.C. Berkeley in 2009, Apache Spark has become one of the key big data distributed processing frameworks in the world. Spark can be deployed in various ways, provides native bindings for the Java, Scala, Python, and R programming languages, and supports SQL, streaming data, machine learning, and graph processing. You’ll find it used by banks, telecommunications companies, games companies, governments, and all major tech giants such as Apple, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft.

Databricks provides [an excellent overview](https://databricks.com/spark/about) as well.
### Rules of thumb for Spark

We are learning to use Spark as a Data Scientist or Analyst, which needs tools for exploring and analyzing data that pushes the boundaries of our local memory and time constraints associated with analyzing 'big' data.  As we explore this space, we will need to keep in mind a few [rules of thumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb) that should guide our use of Spark.
#### The Spark APIs let you use your language of preference

You can use Java, Scala, Python, or R to access Spark.  Like [Goldilocks and the Three Bears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle), we want the language that is not 'too hot' or 'too cold' for data science use.  Java is a bit too verbose for day-to-day data science work. Scala is fast but still a little verbose. Python is a little slower but ingrained in the data science community, and R is less easy to implement in a production environment.  

- __pyspark (just right)__: The [pyspark package](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html) looks to be the 'just the right amount' of the Spark APIs.  
- __sparkR (a little cold)__: [Apache has developed an R package](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sparkr.html) that is the official R connection to Spark.
- __sparklyr (RStudio's warm-up)__: If you are experienced with the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), then [RStudio's sparklyr](https://spark.rstudio.com/) could pull you away from pyspark.

You can read a comparison of sparkR and sparklyr [here](https://developpaper.com/deep-comparative-data-science-toolbox-sparkr-vs-sparklyr/).

#### Use DataFrames (ignore RDDs)

For day-to-day data science use, `DataFrame`s are the option you should choose.  

1. Spark has built a framework to optimize Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) use when we program with `DataFrame` methods.
2. Spark internally stores `DataFrame`s in a binary format, so there is no need to serialize and deserialize data as it moves over the cluster.

Databricks provides a [Deep Dive into Spark SQL’s Catalyst Optimizer](https://databricks.com/blog/2015/04/13/deep-dive-into-spark-sqls-catalyst-optimizer.html) and [A Tale of Three Apache Spark APIs: RDDs vs. DataFrames and Datasets](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/07/14/a-tale-of-three-apache-spark-apis-rdds-dataframes-and-datasets.html) to help you understand more depth on the relationship between `DataFrame`s.

We pulled the bullets and image below from the Databricks articles.

> - If you want unification and simplification of APIs across Spark Libraries, use DataFrame or Dataset.
> - If you are an R user, use DataFrames.
> - If you are a Python user, use DataFrames and resort back to RDDs if you need more control.

#### Write and Read serialized data formats

The [Apache Parquet](https://databricks.com/glossary/what-is-parquet) format is optimal for most data science applications. It is a serialized columnar format that provides speed and size benefits for big data applications. The following table compares the savings and the speedup obtained by converting data into Parquet from CSV.

| Dataset                              | Size on Amazon S3           | Query Run Time | Data Scanned          | Cost          |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| Data stored as CSV files             | 1 TB                        | 236 seconds    | 1.15 TB               | $5.75         |
| Data stored in Apache Parquet Format | 130 GB                      | 6.78 seconds   | 2.51 GB               | $0.01         |
| Savings                              | 87% less when using Parquet | 34x faster     | 99% less data scanned | 99.7% savings |

You could use [Avro with Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-avro.html) as well.  It is stored in rows, much like a `.csv` file, but is serialized.
#### Pick Spark SQL over user defined functions (UDFs)

Python or R UDFs probably are never faster than Spark SQL. Since SQL functions are relatively simple and are not designed for complex tasks, it is pretty much impossible to compensate for the cost of repeated serialization, deserialization, and data movement between a Python or R interpreter and JVM.

Unlike UDFs, Spark SQL functions operate directly on JVM and are typically well integrated with Catalyst and Tungsten. It means these can be optimized in the execution plan and most of the time can benefit from [codgen and other Tungsten optimizations](https://databricks.com/blog/2015/04/28/project-tungsten-bringing-spark-closer-to-bare-metal.html). Moreover, these can operate on data in its "native" representation. UDFs, on the other hand, are implemented in Python and require moving data back and forth. [ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38296609/spark-functions-vs-udf-performance)
##### Spark SQL Functions

Apache has provided [searchable documentation of the available Spark SQL APIs](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/) or you can use the [sparkbyexamples searchable tables](https://sparkbyexamples.com/spark/spark-sql-functions/). Take the time to get comfortable with what is available. When we discuss leveraging Spark SQL, we include the methods associated with a [DataFrame object](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.DataFrame). Most of the time, these methods have the same name as the related SQL function.  
##### User Defined Functions (UDFs)

We want to avoid UDFs as much as possible. However, there are times when we have a complex calculation that goes beyond the Spark SQL functions.  The UDF syntax is unique to the language you are using with Spark.

- [UDFs in R](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sparkr.html#applying-user-defined-function): [Notebook example]
- [UDFs in Python](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/spark-sql/udf-python.html): [Notebook example](scripts/pyspark_udf.ipynb)
- [UDFs in Scala](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/spark-sql/udf-scala.html) are not covered in this guide.

If you need to move into UDFs, we highly recommend configuring your system to leverage [Pandas UDFs](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-pyspark-pandas-with-arrow.html#pandas-udfs-aka-vectorized-udfs).  We will leverage them when we move to DataBricks.

#### Caching data in memory 

In Spark, the DataFrames interim computations are not stored in memory. The DataFrames are only evaluated when the action is called. If we have expensive transformations, then using `cache()` (or `persist()` for more refined control) can speed up your EDA. __Note: The use of caching can crash your Spark session when you are in a local Docker container with limited memory.__

#### Spark Sessions need your attention

We will want to set many configurations as we leverage Spark for our data science projects.  Systems like DataBricks have optimized many of these, but we will still need to understand how to configure our Spark Sessions.  __Please review the [configuration.md](configuration.md) to see the configurations we need for the [all-spark-notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/all-spark-notebook) we built using [docker_guide](https://github.com/BYUI451/docker_guide).__
